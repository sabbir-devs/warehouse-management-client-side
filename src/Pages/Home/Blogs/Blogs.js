              Q.2. What are the different ways to manage a state in a React
              application?
            </h2>
            <h5 className="text-sxl text-green-500">
              There are four main types of state you need to properly manage in
              your React apps:
            </h5>
            <p>
              <b>
                <u>Local (UI) state Local state:</u>
              </b>{" "}
              Local (UI) state Local state is data we manage in one or another
              component. Local state is most often managed in React using the
              useState hook.
            </p>
            <p>
              <b>
                <u>Global (UI) state Global state:</u>
              </b>{" "}
              Global (UI) state Global state is data we manage across multiple
              components. Global state is necessary when we want to get and
              update data anywhere in our app, or in multiple components at
              least.
            </p>
            <p>
              <b>
                <u>Server state:</u>
              </b>{" "}
              Server state Data that comes from an external server that must be
              integrated with our UI state. Server state is a simple concept,
              but can be hard to manage alongside all of our local and global UI
              state.
            </p>
            <p>
              <b>
                <u>URL state:</u>
              </b>{" "}
              Data that exists on our URLs, including the pathname and query
              parameters. URL state is often missing as a category of state, but
              it is an important one. In many cases, a lot of major parts of our
              application rely upon accessing URL state. Try to imagine building
              a blog without being able to fetch a post based off of its slug or
              id that is located in the URL!

              Q.3. How does prototypical inheritance work?
            </h2>
            <p>
              The Prototypal Inheritance is a feature in javascript used to add
              methods and properties in objects. It is a method by which an
              object can inherit the properties and methods of another object.
              Traditionally, in order to get and set the [[Prototype]] of an
              object, we use Object.getPrototypeOf and Object.

              Q.4. What is a unit test? Why should write unit tests?
            </h2>
            <p>
              The main objective of unit testing is to isolate written code to
              test and determine if it works as intended. Unit testing is an
              important step in the development process, because if done
              correctly, it can help detect early flaws in code which may be
              more difficult to find in later testing stages.

            <h2 className="text-xl text-green-500 font-bold">
              Q.5. Why you do not set the state directly in React. For example,
              if you have const [products, setProducts] = useState([]). Why you
              do not set products = [...] instead, you use the setProducts
            </h2>
            <p>
              One should never update the products directly because If you
              update it directly, calling the setProducts() afterward may just
              replace the update you made. When you directly update the state,
              it does not change this.state immediately. Instead, it creates a
              pending state transition, and accessing it after calling this
              method will only return the present value. You will lose control
              of the state across all components. Thats why we don't use
              setProducts directly.
